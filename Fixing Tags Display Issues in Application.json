Tags are properly split by commas and trimmed for whitespace when a new post is created.\n2. New tags are added to the \"Popular Tags\" section on the home page after a page refresh.\n\nLet's start by identifying the root cause of each problem.\n\n### Problem 1: Tags are broken up into individual characters on the post view page\n\nThis issue typically occurs when the tags are not being properly split and stored as an array. Instead, they might be stored as a single string, which is then displayed character by character.\n\n### Problem 2: New tags are not shown on the home page under \"Popular Tags\"\n\nThis issue could be due to the tags not being saved correctly in the database or not being fetched correctly when the home page is loaded.\n\n### Steps to Fix the Issues\n\n#### Step 1: Review and Update Tag Handling in the Backend\n\n1. **Check how tags are being processed when a new post is created.**\n\n   - Ensure that the tags are being split by commas and stored as an array in the database.\n\n2. **Check how tags are being retrieved and displayed on the post view page.**\n\n   - Ensure that the tags are being fetched as an array and properly displayed.\n\n3. **Check how tags are being retrieved and displayed on the home page.**\n\n   - Ensure that new tags are being added to the \"Popular Tags\" section.\n\n#### Step 2: Modify the Code\n\nLet's start by checking the backend code where the post creation happens.\n\n1. **Backend: Post Creation**\n\n   ```python\n   # Assuming a Flask-based backend\n\n   @app.route('/create_post', methods=['POST'])\n   def create_post():\n       data = request.get_json()\n       title = data.get('title')\n       body = data.get('body')\n       tags = data.get('tags', '')\n\n       # Split tags by comma and trim whitespace\n       tags_list = [tag.strip() for tag in tags.split(',') if tag.strip()]\n\n       # Save the post and tags to the database\n       post = Post(title=title, body=body, tags=tags_list)\n       db.session.add(post)\n       db.session.commit()\n\n       return jsonify({'message': 'Post created successfully'}), 201\n   ```\n\n2. **Backend: Fetching Tags for the Home Page**\n\n   ```python\n   @app.route('/tags', methods=['GET'])\n   def get_tags():\n       tags = Tag.query.all()\n       popular_tags = [tag.name for tag in tags]\n       return jsonify({'tags': popular_tags})\n   ```\n\n#### Step 3: Update the Frontend\n\n1. **Frontend: Displaying Tags on the Post View Page**\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Assuming a React-based frontend\n\n   const PostView = ({ post }) => {\n       return (\n           <div>\n               <h1>{post.title}</h1>\n               <p>{post.body}</p>\n               <ul>\n                   {post.tags.map(tag => (\n                       <li key={tag}>{tag}</li>\n                   ))}\n               </ul>\n           </div>\n       );\n   };\n   ```\n\n2. **Frontend: Displaying Popular Tags on the Home Page**\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Assuming a React-based frontend\n\n   const HomePage = () => {\n       const [tags, setTags] = useState([]);\n\n       useEffect(() => {\n           fetch('/tags')\n               .then(response => response.json())\n               .then(data => setTags(data.tags));\n       }, []);\n\n       return (\n           <div>\n               <h2>Popular Tags</h2>\n               <ul>\n                   {tags.map(tag => (\n                       <li key={tag}>{tag}</li>\n                   ))}\n               </ul>\n           </div>\n       );\n   };\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Fix\n\n1. **Create a new post with tags: \"coding, testing\".**\n2. **Verify that the tags are displayed correctly on the post view page.**\n3. **Refresh the home page and verify that the new tags appear under \"Popular Tags\".**\n\n### Generate Git Diff\n\nAfter making the necessary code changes, you can generate a git diff to share your changes.\n\n```bash\ngit diff > changes.diff\n```\n\nThis will create a file named `changes.diff` with all the changes you've made."}]}
